# Launch CodeSphere in Gitpod

## üöÄ One-Click Launch

Click this button to open CodeSphere IDE in Gitpod:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fenago/lvngide)

## What Happens When You Click?

1. **Gitpod creates a cloud workspace** (takes ~30 seconds)
2. **Automatically installs dependencies** (~3-5 minutes first time)
3. **Builds the application** (~5-10 minutes first time)
4. **Starts CodeSphere IDE** automatically
5. **Opens in your browser** at port 3000

## First Time Setup

The first launch will take ~10-15 minutes total because it:
- Installs all npm dependencies
- Builds extensions
- Compiles the application
- Downloads plugins

**Subsequent launches are MUCH faster** (~2 minutes) because Gitpod caches the build!

## How to Use

1. Click the "Open in Gitpod" button above
2. Sign in with your GitHub account (if not already)
3. Wait for the workspace to initialize
4. CodeSphere will automatically open in a new browser tab
5. Start coding!

## Free Tier

Gitpod free tier includes:
- **50 hours/month** of workspace time
- **4 parallel workspaces**
- **30GB storage**

That's plenty for development!

## Tips

- **Prebuilds**: After the first launch, Gitpod will prebuild your workspace on every commit, making subsequent launches instant
- **Workspace Timeout**: Workspaces stop after 30 minutes of inactivity (free tier)
- **Snapshots**: You can create snapshots to save your workspace state

## Alternative: Direct URL

You can also open any GitHub branch/PR in Gitpod by prepending the URL with `https://gitpod.io/#`

Example:
```
https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fenago/lvngide/tree/your-branch
```

## Troubleshooting

**Workspace not starting?**
- Check your Gitpod dashboard: https://gitpod.io/workspaces
- Stop any old workspaces and try again

**Build failing?**
- Check the terminal output in Gitpod
- The build logs will show what went wrong

**Application not loading?**
- Wait for "Root Server listening on port 3000" message
- Click the "Open Browser" button in the Ports panel
